# Contribution guidelines

We welcome feedback on the visual abstract ideas. First of all, comments are very welcome! 

But we especially welcome specific examples of your software engineering research contribution (or ideas!) captured using a visual abstract template.  Please add the citation of the related paper(s) (if relevant) to your commit message. 
For research that can be viewed through a design science lens, we provide a template.  

We also welcome suggestions on how to improve the existing template(s) or to add or propose new templates. 

To contribute a new template suggestion or a visual abstract for your research, please either submit a pull request with a commit message describing your contribution or send an email with your contribution to mstorey@uvic.ca.
